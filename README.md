# 40P(%) Keyboard

## Why
Buddy wanted to design a keyboard. I wanted a 40% keyboard. We put our engineering degrees to use and made one. 

I also recently designed a PCB in Altium and learned a lot from the experience, so wanted to take a shot at using KiCad. 
This repo only contains my personal contributions to the project.

## Dependencies
I used [Ruiqi Mao's Guide](https://github.com/ruiqimao/keyboard-pcb-guide?tab=readme-ov-file) as a starting point. 
From there I got the [TMK Symbols](https://github.com/tmk/kicad_lib_tmk), [TMK Footprints](https://github.com/tmk/keyboard_parts.pretty), and [Keebs.Pretty Switches](https://github.com/egladman/keebs.pretty?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme)
